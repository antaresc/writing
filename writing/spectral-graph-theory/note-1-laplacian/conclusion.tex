\section{Conclusion}

In this note, we introduced the graph Laplacian and saw some examples that connected the spectrum of the Laplacian to extremal graph properties like connectivity and bipartiteness. These connections were facilitated by the variational characterization of eigenvalues, and one thing that was mentioned was how this way of describing eigenvalues easily lends itself to optimization settings.
