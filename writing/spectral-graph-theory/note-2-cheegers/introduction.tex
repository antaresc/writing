Last time, we alluded that the spectrum of the Laplacian allows us to continuously measure combinatorial properties of a graph. We will make this statement precise by introducing a notion of connectivity called graph conductance. This will lead us to Cheeger's isoperimetric inequality which relates graph conductance to the second smallest eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian.
