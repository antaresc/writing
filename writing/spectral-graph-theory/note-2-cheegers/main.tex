% Some thoughts on how to write this
% - start with two examples, the path and the clique
% - make the kinda spurious link to connectivity
% - introduce conductance and say how even this is interesting in its own right. One would think
%   that highly connected graphs have to be dense, but now we can ask, is there a highly connected
%   graph that is sparse? (indeed that is what expanders are).
% - Maybe cite the Jellyfish paper / and the image segmentation paper to show that it's quite useful
%   actually.
% - introduce the normalized laplacian
% - introduce cheeger's inequality: say something about why this makes spectral graph theory very useful:
%   in an algorithmic sense like it's not enough just to say that the spectrum captures
%   extremal properties, because we can always efficiently verify that by running a BFS. What makes
%   this powerful is that it really allows us to measure combinatorial properties like connectivity
%   in a continuous manner.
% - prove cheeger's
% - say something about the tightness of the inequality and the i n e v i t a b i l i t y of the proof
% - hint towards higher order cheegers by stating connectivity as the closeness to having two
%   disjoint connected components and the lambda_k result
